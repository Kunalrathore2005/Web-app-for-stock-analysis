Web App for Stock Analysis
A lightweight web application to analyze stock market data, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to view stock prices and visualize historical trends through interactive charts.
Features

Display current stock price and basic details.
Visualize historical stock price trends with an interactive line chart.
Responsive design for desktop and mobile users.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
An API key for stock data (e.g., from Alpha Vantage). Replace the placeholder API key in app.js with your own.


Navigate to the project directory:cd Web-app-for-stock-analysis




Open the app:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the app.
Alternatively, use a local server (e.g., VS Code’s Live Server extension) for a better experience.



Usage

Launch the app by opening index.html in a browser.
Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) in the search bar.
View the current stock price and details.
